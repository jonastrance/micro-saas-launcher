# Micro SaaS Launcher

Micro SaaS Launcher is a no-code platform that helps entrepreneurs build and deploy profitable micro-SaaS businesses in under 48 hours. The platform provides pre-built templates for popular SaaS categories (invoicing, booking systems, CRM tools, analytics dashboards), integrated Stripe billing, user authentication, and one-click deployment to cloud hosting. Users select a template, customize branding and features through a visual editor, and launch their SaaS product with a custom domain. Each deployed micro-SaaS runs independently, allowing creators to build multiple products without technical expertise. Monetization comes from a marketplace model where the platform earns 15% of all recurring revenue generated by deployed SaaS products, creating compound passive income as users build their product portfolios. The platform also offers premium templates ($99-$499), advanced customization tools ($39/month), and done-for-you setup services ($999 one-time) for non-technical entrepreneurs.
